    <h1><span class="entry-symbol">-/</span> Minesweeper AI, not so good but realistic.</h1>

    <p>After seeing some videos of AI resolving minesweeper, I was a bit dissapointed when looking at the strategies used.</p>
    <p>Yeah they are really fast, but they all use exactly the same way of solving it: <strong>backtracking</strong>.</p>

    <p>A recursive technique which consists on building your solution one step at a time, and skipping the actual opportunity as soon as it doesn't fit your constraints.</p>
    <p>Involving a lot of things to remember, this strategy is not something that is used by humans (maybe some aliens can do it in the end where there are like 2 or 3 mines left).</p>
    <p>So, as excellent as it can be, it is only based on one strategy, which is kinda boring in the end.</p>

    <h2><span class="section-symbol">$</span> What is the idea then ?</h2>

    <p>I would like the AI to resolve it like a human would, but how do we resolve a MineSweeper game ?</p>
    <p>I played a little bit on this game to realise how I was dealing with it, the strategy that I used during thoses is quite simple:</p>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="left-section">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Looking for places with the same number of <strong>unmarked tiles</strong> and <strong>remamining bombs to discover</strong>.</p>
            <p>We can then simply mark all the tiles around without even thinking.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="right-section">
        <img src="img/minesweeper_strat1.png">
      </div>

      <div class="left-section">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Very simillar to the first one, we'll search for tiles that have the same number of <strong>marked bombs</strong> around and <strong>amount of bombs written</strong> on them.</p>
            <p>This way, we can just discover all of the remaining tiles around with the certainty that they are safe. </p>
            <p>Using theses tro first strategies can make you finish <strong>really</strong> simple games, when increasing the amount of bombs, the winrate will drop as you'll need to gamble a lot more.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="right-section">
        <img src="img/minesweeper_strat1.png">
      </div>

      <div class="left-section">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Then we have the pattern recognition, we are looking for some simple patterns that assure the placement of 1, 2 or even 3 mines sometimes !</p>
            <p>Once they have been discovered, we can do the first strategy again in the area and maybe unlock the situation.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
